## Francesca G. Tomasi

I am currently a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institutes of Health doing tuberculosis drug discovery research. I also run an independent website, www.InfectivePerspective.com, which features news, scientific advancements, and current issues relevant to infectious diseases. It is my goal to bring together creatively a passion for microbes, research, and education to work toward eliminating the burdens of global infectious diseases.
